	In this task participants are required to judge whether the presented stimuli are the same or different. The stimuli are presented simultaneously and reaction time is measured. This experiment is based on Pattern Comparison Task (Simultaneous) by Perez et al. (1987). This experiment differs from Perez et al. (1987) experiment in the following ways:
 - number of trials.
